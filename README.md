# Why this repo?
Yesterday I came across [this news](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/over-12000-maharashtra-farmers-committed-suicide-in-3-years-govt/?fbclid=IwAR0p3tjxMoehNhpzLg4_WlCj3T0ZMYzIkZH4e2LpIqvQ5WDBBE_IBdgHwOc) and was deeply saddened by the fact that so many farmers are committing suicides and we're not able to help them out. So, I asked this question to myself (and my friends), that what can we, as Engineers, do to solve this problem. This repo is a log of fruitful discussions I had about this and will hopefully lead to something substantial, someday :).

`Note 1: I understand that to solve this problem, at scale, Govt. needs to do lots of things, and we have to believe/accept that the Govt. is doing what it can do (otherwise we should be in politics), So, we can't crib about Govt./Country/Population etc (atleast on this repo). These are constraints to our optimization problem!` 

`Note 2: Contributions of Ideas/References/Links to Agricultural-Datasets/<Anything else which you feel might be useful for engineers working in agricultural domain> etc are most welcome on this repo.`

### Ideas

* A tool/platform which can raise funds in case of drought/when farmers are in dire need of money - because of which they eventually commit suicide -  like paytm etc do in case of floods, earthquake or any other natural calamity. We need to build something like this especially for farmers, we need to have a mediator, backed by technology, which can directly connect needy farmers and those who can donate. We need an organization to maintain this platform's credibility and to run it!
* Generate passive sources of income, so that agriculture is not the only source of income for farmers. They should be able to participate remotely in that activity. One such activity - is dataset collection - but this isn't sustainable. Because of boom in ML and AI, dataset collection has become a business activity, and it can be done remotely. Something similar to Amazon Mechanical Turk but should not require heavy capital initially.
